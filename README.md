# Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-for-Manufacturing-Systems
DESCRIPTION
We are Team 28. We have four students (Xinran Shi, Pengfei Chen, Yuchen Wen, Xiaowei Yue) from ISyE, and one student (Yuqi Cao) from School of Music. Our project focuses on "Data Analytics and Visualization for Manufacturing Systems".
The objective of this research is to develop a Big Data analytics and visualization framework for complex manufacturing systems through systematic and deep integration of data analytics, visualization and manufacturing domain knowledge. The project consists of three modules:
(1)Data collection, management, cleaning and preliminary analysis.
(2)Feature learning, correlation analysis, hierarchical clustering and predictive modeling.
(3)User-friendly interface allowing the user, with few data visualization/analytics skills, to interact with datasets and make intelligent decisions.
Our main contributions include:
(1)A systematic framework for big data analytics and visualization has been developed for smart manufacturing systems
(2)The global/local correlation map, hierarchical clustering, and modeling are explored
(3)We provide an interactive D3 interface for manufacturing engineers

EXECUTION
For D3, please run the "team28_D3_code/bosch_bihi/final_testing.html" via Firefox. 
(1)You may double click, drag, ... to explore the station you are interested in. 
(2) You may check the dynamically updating station ranking of failure rate. Usually we explore the stations with highest failure rate firstly. 
(3) After you find the station you are interested in, you may check the local correlation map by choosing specific station in the bottom-left module. The local correlation map tell us association relationship among features. 
Manufacturing engineers can interact with the Manufacturing Big Data via our proposed platform, and do detection, diagnosis and future prediction.
